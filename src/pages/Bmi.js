        Body mass index (BMI) is a person’s weight in kilograms divided by the
        square of height in meters. BMI is an inexpensive and easy screening
        method for weight category—underweight, healthy weight, overweight, and
        obesity. BMI does not measure body fat directly, but BMI is moderately
        correlated with more direct measures of body fat 1,2,3. Furthermore, BMI
        appears to be as strongly correlated with various metabolic and disease
        outcome as are these more direct measures of body fatness

      <p>
        BMI can be a screening tool, but it does not diagnose the body fatness
        or health of an individual. To determine if BMI is a health risk, a
        healthcare provider performs further assessments. Such assessments
        include skinfold thickness measurements, evaluations of diet, physical
        activity, and family history
